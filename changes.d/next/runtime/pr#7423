PR#7423, GPR#946: expose new exception-raising functions
`void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}_value(value msg)`
in addition to
`void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}(char const *msg)`.
The previous functions would not free their message argument, so
were inconvient for dynamically-allocated messages; the messages
passed to the new functions are handled by the garbage collector.
